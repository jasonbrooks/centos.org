#Real Users, Real Stories
{:.no_toc}

The CentOS ecosystem has been built up with and around people. With no real commercial ambition we set out to try and solve problems for people as they exist in the sysadmin / operations trenches around the world. This page will try and collect some of the user stories over the next few months. 

If you have one you'd like to offer up, get in touch with me at http://wiki.centos.org/KaranbirSingh

##Intel Reference Recipe: Clustering with Warewulf and CentOS
[The WareWulf Project](http://warewulf.lbl.gov/trac) sponsored by the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov/) has put together an excellent recipe detailing the installation and configuration of their software, using CentOS and Intel hardware as the foundation they build upon. This clustering recipe now lives on intel's [Cluster Ready](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-cluster-ready-partner-resource-library) Library website. The guide lives here in a [zip archive](http://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/Intel_Cluster_Ready_Reference_Design-S2600GZ-ICR1.3-WAREWULF3.4-CENTOS6.3-C1-v1.0.zip)
