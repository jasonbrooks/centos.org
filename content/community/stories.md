The CentOS ecosystem has been built up with and around people. With no real commercial ambition we set out to try and solve problems for people as they exist in the sysadmin / operations trenches around the world. This page will try and collect some of the user stories over the next few months. 

If you have one you'd like to offer up, get in touch with me at http://wiki.centos.org/KaranbirSingh
