<h1 class="no_toc" id="centos-governance---voting">CentOS Governance - Voting</h1>
<p><a href="/about/governance">« Back to Governance</a></p>

<p>The voting system used by all SIGs and the Governing Board uses a <a href="/about/governance/appendix-glossary/#consensus-decision-making">consensus-based decision model</a> except where noted.</p>

<p>Except where noted, decisions require 3 yes votes (+1) and no objections (-1’s) and, except as noted below, votes should be left open for at least 72 hours. Any Board member may cast a vote in any SIG vote and it is considered binding (counted against the vote). If a vote is held on a public list (e.g., to test the broader consensus of a group) only the votes of the Board members for Board votes or SIG committers or Board members for SIG votes are considered binding. All other votes are just considered as valuable data in the decision process. Board business may be conducted on a private or public list, whichever is more appropriate for the issue at hand.</p>

<p>All -1s votes require reason/ explanation, -1’s with no substantiation may be overturned.</p>

<h2 id="when-do-votes-need-to-be-called">When do votes need to be called?</h2>
<p>Votes need to be called for all substantial business. Votes need to be left open for a reasonable period (not less than 72 hours) if members of the Board are not available to participate in the vote; provided that for votes/matters that have been deemed time or business critical by Red Hat, as noted below, voting must be held open until the Liaison has voted.</p>

<p><em>Lazy consensus</em> may be used for non-substantial business. Lazy consensus is defined as asking for objections as opposed to calling for a vote. Any objection on lazy consensus is considered the same as a -1 on a vote. There is no minimum +1 vote requirement.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-the-liaison">Role of the Liaison</h2>
<p>The Liaison also has the role of dealing with issues such as security, export, or items that have a direct legal or other Red Hat business connection for the Project, and on issues of such business may have an additional role as defined by the following:</p>

<p>A. If a decision/solution cannot be found on an issue that is deemed time and/or business critical by Red Hat then, after a reasonable time, the Liaison may be requested by the Chair to seek assistance from Red Hat in making the decision, obtaining additional input from Red Hat executives, engineers, and stakeholders.</p>

<p>B.  The Liaison may, in exceptional circumstances, make a decision on behalf of the Board if a consensus has not been reached on an issue that is deemed time or business critical by Red Hat if:  (1) a board quorum (i.e., a majority) is present or a quorum of Board members has cast their votes; or (2) after 3 working days if a Board quorum is not present at a meeting or a quorum has not cast their votes (list votes); provided that the Chair may (or at the request of the Liaison, will) call a meeting and demand that a quorum be present.</p>

<p>Unless the Liaison specifically indicates on a specific issue that he/she is acting in his/her official capacity as Liaison, either prior to a vote or later (e.g., after an issue has been deemed time or business critical), the Liaison’s voice and vote is treated the same as any other member of the Board. Decisions indicated as Liaison decisions made on behalf of the Board by the Liaison may not be overturned.</p>
