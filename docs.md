# CentOS Documentation

At the current time the CentOS Project does not have the time nor manpower to produce documentation for the supported CentOS Linux releases. 

The upstream documentation is, with certain exceptions such as subscription manager, applicable to CentOS Linux and can be used in its place and can be found at access.redhat.com.
